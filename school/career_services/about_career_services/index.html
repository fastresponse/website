<div>Fast Response School of Healthcare Education&rsquo;s Career Services Department will be distinguished as a vital department of school that turns people into students, students into graduates, and graduates into professionals.</div>

<div><strong><a name="Mission_Statement"></a>Mission Statement</strong></div>
<div>The mission of Fast Response School of Healthcare Education&rsquo;s Career Services Department is:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To increase enrollment by working with other departments so potential students are comforted by admissions representatives and other central figures about concerns with finding employment in a competitive job market.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To further the cohesion and synergy of the facility and communicate efficiently with other departments on how to effectively achieve one common goal: helping students succeed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To increase student retention by administering a level of superior professional development that motivates students to earn their Certificate of Completion so they are fully prepared in the field and for the job search.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To offer students the highest number of opportunities possible by forging and maintaining bonds with new and current employers interested in our graduates.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To provide employers with the information necessary to assure their understanding of the curricula and training programs that equip our graduates for any job openings employers may offer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To improve the community and current job market by preparing students for the challenges faced in finding, interviewing for and maintaining jobs in the health industry and providing medical facilities with access to a pool of skilled applicants.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong><a name="Benefits"></a>Benefits</strong></div>
<div><u>Students</u></div>
<div>Students benefit exorbitantly from the career services department. The coaching and workshops help develop them professionally so they are prepared mentally and physically for the challenges one faces in finding a job in a competitive economy. There are library resources and computer work stations available. Students may schedule appointments or stop by during office hours.</div>
<div class="rteright">&nbsp;</div>
<div><u>Graduates and Alumni/Alumnae</u></div>
<div>Our alumni are encouraged to maintain contact long after they&rsquo;ve received their certificate of completion so that they are reminded of how they are still eligible for help in finding job opportunities. Graduates can benefit from the career service department before they leave the building with their cert or take a hiatus before returning for guidance and direction in the job search. Whether a member of our first graduating class or counting down the days, all of our alumni and alumnae may enjoy the services our department has to offer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><u>Academics</u></div>
<div>The career services department will free students from the burden of entering the job market without adequate training. This in turn allows students use their time more lucratively by reviewing notes and homework rather than spending additional time and resources for coaching or learning by trial-and-error exactly how to professionally prepare oneself. Students have security in the resources they need within the department to become a skilled jobseeker so they may study more for the upcoming final and become a skilled healthcare service practitioner. Students will have access to library resources that offer extra help beyond textbooks, lectures and skills workshops.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><u>Employers</u></div>
<div>Employers will have access to information on the varying curricula, externship information, students&rsquo; training, and other details about the program at their behest. Relationships with employers and the school will be maintained continuously by the career services department so that employers are properly informed about and can depend on our graduates for reliable, well-trained workers. In addition to potential employees, employers will also have access to supplies the school has to offer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><u>Community</u></div>
<div>With our graduates entering into the medical field, the community prospers. Healthcare will be enriched because our graduates receive more than the standard hours of training and superior hands-on experience via externships. Graduates from our school are trained beyond the minimal requirements to ensure they execute their job to the highest degree so that ill or injured members of the community receive better-quality treatment. A skilled healthcare practitioner produces a finer medical service, resulting in a healthier community and thus, a stronger community.</div>

<div><strong><a name="Office_Location"></a>Office Location</strong></div>
<div>The office for the Career Services Department is within proximity of the offices of the admission representatives to ensure a seamless transition between departments when explaining the programs, opportunities and statistics to answer any questions current and potential students might have. The office has an open-door policy for students to casually stop by with questions and concerns. To ensure that a student&rsquo;s visit is productive, an element of privacy is available so individual appointments may run smoothly without interruption, particularly mock interviews, coaching, and other appointments in which students might feel uncomfortable if witnessed by their peers.&nbsp;</div>
