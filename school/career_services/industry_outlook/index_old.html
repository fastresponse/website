<div><u><a name="overview_emt"></a>Overview</u></div>
<div>In an emergency, EMTs and paramedics are typically dispatched by a 911 operator to the scene, where they often work with police and fire fighters. Once they arrive, EMTs and paramedics assess the nature of the patient's condition and determine whether the patient has any pre-existing medical conditions. EMTs and paramedics also operate in emergency medical services systems where a physician provides medical direction and oversight.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>EMTs and paramedics use special equipment, such as backboards, to immobilize patients before placing them on stretchers and securing them in the ambulance. During the transport of a patient, one EMT or paramedic drives, while the other monitors the patient's vital signs and gives additional care, as needed. Some paramedics work as part of a helicopter's flight crew to quickly transport critically ill or injured patients to hospital trauma centers.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>At the medical facility, EMTs and paramedics help transfer patients to the emergency department, report their observations and actions to emergency department staff, and may provide additional emergency treatment. After each run, EMTs and paramedics document the trip, replace used supplies and check equipment. EMTs and paramedics decontaminate the interior of the ambulance and report cases to the proper authorities if necessary. EMTs and paramedics also provide transportation for patients from one medical facility to another, particularly if they work for private ambulance services.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The specific responsibilities of EMTs and paramedics depend on their level of qualification and training. The EMT-Basic represents the first response of the emergency medical system. An EMT trained at this level is prepared to care for patients at the scene of an accident and while transporting patients by ambulance to the hospital under the direction of more highly trained medical personnel. The EMT-Basic has the emergency skills to assess a patient's condition and manage respiratory, cardiac, and trauma emergencies. Paramedics provide more extensive pre-hospital care than do EMTs. Paramedics administer medications orally and intravenously, interpret electrocardiograms (EKGs), perform endotracheal intubations, and use monitors and other complex equipment.</div>

<div><u><a name="employment_emt"></a>Employment</u></div>
<div>EMTs and paramedics held about 210,700 jobs in 2008. Most career EMTs and paramedics work in metropolitan areas. Volunteer EMTs and paramedics are more common in small cities, towns, and rural areas. These individuals volunteer for fire departments, emergency medical services, or hospitals and may respond to only a few calls per month. Paid EMTs and paramedics were employed in a number of industries. About 45% worked as employees of ambulance services. About 29% worked in local government. Another 20% worked in hospitals.</div>

<div><u><a name="working_conditions_EMT"></a>Working Conditions</u></div>
<div>EMTs and paramedics work both indoors and out, in all types of weather. They are required to do considerable kneeling, bending, and heavy lifting. These workers are at a higher risk for contracting illnesses or experiencing injuries on the job than workers in other occupations. They risk noise-induced hearing loss from sirens and back injuries from lifting patients. In addition, EMTs and paramedics may be exposed to communicable diseases, such as hepatitis-B and AIDS, as well as to violence from mentally unstable or combative patients. The work is not only physically strenuous but can be stressful, sometimes involving life-or-death situations and suffering patients. These workers experienced a larger than average number of work-related injuries or illnesses.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div class="rtecenter"><a href="#Top">Back to Top</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><u><a name="Job_outlook_EMT"></a>Job Outlook</u></div>
<div>Employment of EMTs and paramedics is expected to grow 9 % between 2008 and 2018, which is about as fast as the average for all occupations. Growth in this occupation is due in large part to increasing call volume due to aging population. As a large segment of the population becomes more likely to have medical emergencies, demand will increase for EMTs and paramedics. In addition, the time that EMTs and paramedics must spend with each patient is increasing as emergency departments across the country are experiencing overcrowding. As a result, when an ambulance arrives, it takes longer to transfer the patient from the care of the EMTs and paramedics to the staff of the emergency department. Some emergency departments divert ambulances to other hospitals when they are too busy to take on new patients. As a result, ambulances may not be able to go to the nearest hospital, which increases the amount of time spent in transit. Both these factors result in EMTs and paramedics spending more time with each patient, which means more workers are needed to meet demand.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Job prospects should be favorable. Full-time paid EMTs and paramedics will be needed to replace unpaid volunteers. Emergency medical service agencies find it increasingly difficult to recruit and retain unpaid volunteers because of the amount of training and the large time commitment these positions require, and thus more paid EMTs and paramedics are needed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Competition will be greater for jobs in local government, including fire, police, and independent third-service rescue squad departments that tend to have better salaries and benefits. EMTs and paramedics who have advanced education and certifications should enjoy the most favorable job prospects, as clients and patients demand higher levels of care before arriving at the hospital.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Many EMTs and paramedics are required to work more than 40 hours a week. Because emergency services function 24 hours a day, EMTs and paramedics may have irregular working hours.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div class="rtecenter"><a href="#Top">Back to Top</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><u><a name="TQA_EMT"></a>Training, Qualifications and Advancement</u></div>
<div>Generally, a high school diploma is required to enter a training program to become an EMT or paramedic. Workers must complete a formal training and certification process. Training is offered at progressive levels: EMT-Basic and Paramedic.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>At the EMT-Basic level, coursework emphasizes emergency skills, such as managing respiratory, trauma, and cardiac emergencies, and patient assessment. Formal courses are often combined with time in an emergency department or ambulance. The program provides instruction and practice in dealing with bleeding, fractures, airway obstruction, cardiac arrest, and emergency childbirth. Students learn how to use and maintain common emergency equipment, such as backboards, suction devices, splints, oxygen delivery systems, and stretchers. Graduates of approved EMT-Basic training programs must pass a written and practical examination administered by the State licensing agency or the NREMT.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The most advanced level of training for this occupation is Paramedic. At this level, the caregiver receives training in anatomy and physiology as well as advanced medical skills. Training programs offered by community colleges and technical schools and may take up to one to two years. Such education prepares the graduate to take the NREMT examination to become certified as a Paramedic. Extensive related coursework and clinical and field experience is required. Refresher courses and continuing education are available for EMTs and paramedics at all levels.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>All 50 States require EMTs and Paramedics to be licensed, but the levels and titles vary from State to State. In most States and the District of Columbia certification by the NREMT is required at some or all levels. Some States administer their own certification examination or provide the option of taking either the NREMT or State examination. In most States, licensure renewal is required every two to three years and generally, EMTs and Paramedics must take refresher training courses or complete continuing education requirements. Many States restrict licensure based on an individual&rsquo;s criminal history.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>EMTs and paramedics should be emotionally stable, have good dexterity, agility, and physical coordination, and be able to lift and carry heavy loads. They also need good eyesight (corrective lenses may be used) with accurate color vision. Many employers require a criminal background check.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Paramedics can become supervisors, operations managers, administrative directors, or executive directors of emergency services. Some EMTs and paramedics become instructors, dispatchers, or physician assistants; others move into sales or marketing of emergency medical equipment. A number of people become EMTs and paramedics to test their interest in healthcare before training as registered nurses, physicians, or other health workers.</div>

<div><u><a name="overview_MA"></a>Overview</u></div>
<div>Medical assistants perform administrative and clinical tasks to keep the offices of physicians, podiatrists, chiropractors, and other health practitioners running smoothly. The duties of medical assistants vary from office to office, depending on the location and size of the practice and the practitioner's specialty. In small practices, medical assistants usually do many different kinds of tasks, handling both administrative and clinical duties and reporting directly to an office manager, physician, or other health practitioner. Those in large practices tend to specialize in a particular area, under the supervision of department administrators. Medical assistants should not be confused with physician assistants, who examine, diagnose, and treat patients under the direct supervision of a physician.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div class="rtecenter"><a href="#Top">Back to Top</a></div>

<div>Medical assistants are ranked among the positions to grow the fastest in the 2008-2018 decade. Medical assistants held about 483,600 jobs in 2008. About 62% worked in offices of physicians; 13% worked hospitals (private and public), including inpatient and outpatient facilities; and 11% worked in offices of chiropractors and optometrists and other health practitioners. Much of the remainder worked in other healthcare industries, such as outpatient care centers and nursing and residential care facilities.</div>

<div><u><a name="working_conditions_MA"></a>Working Conditions</u></div>
<div>Medical assistants work in well-lighted, clean environments. They constantly interact with other people and may have to handle several responsibilities at once. Most full-time medical assistants work a regular 40-hour week. However, medical assistants may work part time, evenings, or weekends.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div class="rtecenter"><a href="#Top">Back to Top</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><u><a name="job_outlook_MA"></a>Job Outlook</u></div>
<div>Employment of medical assistants is expected to grow 34% from 2008 to 2018, much faster than the average for all occupations. As the healthcare industry expands because of technological advances in medicine and the growth and aging of the population, there will be an increased need for all healthcare workers. The increasing prevalence of certain conditions, such as obesity and diabetes, also will increase demand for healthcare services and medical assistants. Increasing use of medical assistants to allow doctors to care for more patients will further stimulate job growth.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Helping to drive job growth is the increasing number of group practices, clinics, and other healthcare facilities that need a high proportion of support personnel, particularly medical assistants who can handle both administrative and clinical duties. In addition, medical assistants work mostly in primary care, a consistently growing sector of the healthcare industry.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Jobseekers who want to work as a medical assistant should find excellent job prospects. Medical assistants are projected to account for a very large number of new jobs, and many other opportunities will come from the need to replace workers leaving the occupation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div class="rtecenter"><a href="#Top">Back to Top</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><u><a name="TQA_MA"></a>Training, Qualifications and Advancement</u></div>
<div>Medical assisting programs are offered in vocational-technical high schools, postsecondary vocational schools, and community and junior colleges. Postsecondary programs usually last either 1 year and result in a certificate or diploma, or 2 years and result in an associate degree. Courses cover anatomy, physiology, and medical terminology, as well as keyboarding, transcription, recordkeeping, accounting, and insurance processing. Students learn laboratory techniques, clinical and diagnostic procedures, pharmaceutical principles, the administration of medications, and first aid. They study office practices, patient relations, medical law, and ethics. There are two accrediting bodies that accredit medical assisting programs. Programs often include an internship that provides practical experience in physicians' offices or other healthcare facilities.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Medical assistants deal with the public; therefore, they must be neat and well groomed and have a courteous, pleasant manner and they must be able to put patients at ease and explain physicians' instructions. They must respect the confidential nature of medical information. Clinical duties require a reasonable level of manual dexterity and visual acuity.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Certification indicates that a medical assistant meets certain standards of knowledge. It may also help to distinguish an experienced or formally trained assistant from an entry-level assistant, which may lead to a higher salary or more employment opportunities. There are various associations that award certification credentials to medical assistants. The certification process varies by association. It is also possible to become certified in a specialty, such as podiatry, optometry, or ophthalmology.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Medical assistants may also advance to other occupations through experience or additional training. For example, some may go on to office manager or other administrative duties, teaching medical assisting, and others pursue additional education to become nurses or other healthcare workers. It is common for medical assistants to certify as phlebotomy technicians and medical administrative specialists.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><u><a name="overview_cpt1"></a>Overview</u></div>
<div>Many who choose a career in the healthcare field decide to begin with and specialize in phlebotomy. This allows for the opportunity to work with doctors, dentists, hospitals, pharmacies, nursing homes, healthcare facilities, vet clinics, rehabilitation centers, insurance companies, blood donation centers, and other facilities. This exposure is beneficial for understanding the implications of working as a phlebotomy technician and determining potential future career paths in the medical field.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The phlebotomy technician&rsquo;s primary duties consist of performing venipunctures, or fingersticks to collect capillary, venous, and sometimes, arterial blood samples into blood collection tubes. The phlebotomist is typically ordered to do so by a medical doctor, or other licensed healthcare practitioner. The phlebotomist then labels, records, and packages the tubes for screening and diagnostic evaluation in a lab.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>There is an opportunity for mobility when working as a phlebotomist. Many do point-of-care testing: they bring themselves to the patient enjoying the flexibility and mobility as well as building a close relationship with different clients. Others prefer less patient contact, less travel, and a more predictable work environment and therefore stay within the parameters of blood sample analysis, and laboratory work.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Duties of the phlebotomy technician include, but are not limited to, identifying a wide variety of tests; selecting appropriate blood collection tubes according to the size and metric volume; estimating the quantity of blood needed in relation to tests ordered; assembling all necessary equipment; labeling tubes with patient name, identification number, date, time, and initials; and preparing samples for storage and transportation. Often they transport specimens from outpatient clinics and outside locations to clinical laboratories. One of the more urgent duties includes responding to emergency requests for immediate specimen pick-up.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Like most positions in the healthcare field, the phlebotomy technicians must be extensively trained in the methods and tools used in the process. There is little to no tolerance of human error because one mistake can result in costly legal services and procedures depending on the importance of the test, the severity of the pain induced and the patient&rsquo;s willingness to file suit.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div class="rtecenter"><a href="#Top">Back to Top</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><u><a name="earnings_cpt1"></a>Earnings</u></div>
<div>Many phlebotomists seek additional training to increase their income and versatility within a workplace. Earnings of phlebotomy technicians depend on the region, experience, training and employment setting.</div>

<div><u><a name="workingconditions_cpt1"></a>Working Conditions</u></div>
<div>Phlebotomy technicians work in hospitals, laboratories, physician's offices, donation facilities and other health care settings where blood samples are drawn and analyzed. Technicians may also travel to patients&rsquo; homes to provide their service with the utmost accommodation for the patient. Much work time is spent standing and walking, and they must be comfortable both in the calm, clinical laboratory setting, as well as interacting with patients who are as conditioned to the procedure as the technician.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In large hospitals or in independent laboratories that operate continuously, technicians usually work the day, evening or night shift and may work on weekends or holidays. Rotating shifts are typical of small facilities that have a small number of staff members. Technicians also take emergency calls several nights a week including weekends.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div class="rtecenter"><a href="#Top">Back to Top</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><u><a name="job_outlook_cpt1"></a>Job Outlook</u></div>
<div>The health care industry is currently experiencing an increase of jobs through the year 2016 according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. There is an estimated 19% growth in phlebotomy. Employment for phlebotomists is expected to grow faster than average for all occupations through next 8 years because the volume of laboratory tests continues to increase with population growth and the development of new types of tests that are available. Advances in biotechnology have increased the number of laboratory tests ordered by physicians, thus increasing the demand for phlebotomists. This makes phlebotomy jobs some of the most valuable jobs for jobseekers.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div class="rtecenter"><a href="#Top">Back to Top</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><u><a name="tqa_cpt1"></a>Training, Qualifications, Advancement</u></div>
<div>The minimum requirement to become a phlebotomy technician is a high school diploma or a GED. California state law mandates that all phlebotomy technicians complete a California Phlebotomy Technician Certification Application in order to draw blood. Adequate education and training of the person responsible for the collection of quality specimens is essential. Otherwise, an improperly collected sample will lead to false lab results and errors that can harm the patient, or even cause their death. Almost certainly it will increase the cost of care. Only through skillful and careful blood drawing procedure can a quality blood sample be obtained, and reliable results be recorded, such as timed tests, e.g. glucose tolerance and drug levels, and special tests such as STATS, blood culture, and tests required to be obtained in a fasting state. If required for the test, they will administer oral diagnostic medications such as glucose, and xylose to patients per the doctor's instructions.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Accredited phlebotomy programs usually take from one semester to one year to complete, culminating in a certificate or diploma. Coursework generally includes anatomy and physiology, blood and cell composition, blood sampling procedures and laboratory safety. Hands-on training includes various methods of drawing blood. Phlebotomy students learn basic venipuncture techniques, butterfly techniques commonly used for the elderly and children with small veins, fingerstick methods for people with damaged or hard-to-find veins, and healstick or capillary puncture for infants. Programs also train students in the skills needed for lab equipment handling and proper methods to clean up spills to prevent infection and physical harm. Some programs also include CPR certification.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Many phlebotomy technicians use their position as a gateway to becoming a phlebotomy instructor, medical assistant, physician&rsquo;s assistant, nurse, doctor or other positions that require additional training.&nbsp;Technicians in the field may specialize in areas such as ophthalmology, optometry, and podiatry after receiving experience from working in a medical facility.&nbsp;</div>

<div>Modern advancements in medicine have allowed for longevity in the average lifetime. Sterilization processes are essential to the improvements in the quality of healthcare. Sterile Processing Technicians are practitioners who implement infection control and aseptic techniques to ensure that surgical instruments and other equipment used for surgery is decontaminated This critical service in healthcare involves processing, storing, and distributing surgical and medical instruments, supplies and other equipment to operating rooms and other areas of hospitals and other medical facilities. There are stringent policies and strict protocol a Sterile Processing Technician must follow because of the importance sterilization has in reducing health risks.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The workplace of a Sterile Processing Technician is a restricted area that requires high standards for patient and employee safety. Before entering the work area she/he must change into hospital or facility supplied clothing and put on personal protective equipment which is required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). Other equipment includes a head cover, mask, gloves, goggles, shoe cover and an apron if necessary. There is absolutely no flexibility with these dress standards.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>There are three area rooms that Sterile Processing Technicians work in: decontamination area, sterile packing and prepping area, and sterile storage area. The breakdown of instrumentation occurs in the decontamination area as well as manual and mechanical cleaning of soiled and/or contaminated items. The sterile packing and prepping area is self-explanatory: it is where instruments are packaged into a pouch (sometimes two pouches to ensure sterilization). This area is where trays are assembled. Trays are labeled and then placed into a container or are wrapped so the instrumentation remains sterile within. Chemical indicators are inserted into every pouch and tray to show if the equipment received sterile treatment or not.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The title Central Service Technician is often used in exchange for Sterile Processing Technician; the two titles are interchangeable.</div>

<div><u><a name="spt_working_conditions"></a>Working Conditions</u></div>
<div>The work areas of Sterile Processing Technicians are kept clean to reduce the chances of contamination. If employed by a medical facility, working irregular hours like evenings and weekends is very likely. Sterile Processing Technicians work a 40 hour work week. Heavy lifting and standing on one&rsquo;s feet for an extended period of time are both routine duties per shift.</div>
<div class="rtecenter"><a href="#Top">Back to Top</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><u><a name="spt_job_outlook"></a>Job Outlook</u></div>
<div>Sterile processing is an emerging occupation and will expand as health care becomes more specialized.</div>
<div>Employment of sterile processing technicians is expected to grow faster than the average for all occupations through the year 2010 as the volume of surgery increases. As the population grows and ages (particularly the baby boom generation), the number of surgical procedures is expected to rise. Fiber optics, laser technology, robotics, interventional radiology and other technological advances will also introduce new surgical procedures and equipment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hospitals are expected to continue as the primary employer of sterile processing technicians, although minimal employment growth is expected in offices and clinics of physicians and dentists, ambulatory surgical centers and assisted living facilities such as nursing homes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>With additional training, some technicians advance to senior sterile processing technicians, who provide technical and functional supervision and/or management to other sterile processing personnel.</div>
<div class="rtecenter"><a href="#Top">Back to Top</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><u><a name="spt_qta"></a>Training, Qualifications, Advancement</u></div>
<div>To work as a Sterile Processing Technician, one does not need certification; however, those that do receive certification are paid more and hired more frequently. Many schools and junior colleges offer Sterile Processing Technician programs that can range from a matter of weeks to a year depending on the intensity of study and the practical application of skills in a medical facility, commonly referred to as an externship or practicum.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The Sterile Processing Technician has the opportunity to transition other similar positions. Depending on the facility, a Sterile Processing Technician may transfer to work as an Operating Room Technician or a Surgical Technician because of the foundation sterile processing provides. After two years of a combination of experience and education, a Sterile Processing Technician may become a Surgical Instrument Technician. Supervisory and Managerial positions are options for advancement in sterile processing but both these types of positions require additional certification. Some facilities will pay for this certification as well as continuing education units, of which a set amount are required to maintain certification as a Sterile Processing Technician.</div>
