      Our five-month long Medical Assistant course is an intensive hands-on program. After completing the classroom portion of the course, students participate in a full-time 4 week externship at a local Kaiser Hospital and a full-time 1 week Phlebotomy Lab where they utilize both their Medical skills. Upon graduation, our students are prepared to take the National Center for Competency Testing Exam to become a licensed Phlebotomist as well as the California Certification Board Exam to become a California Certified Medical Assistant.

      Your first step towards becoming a certified MA is to come see our campus and take a tour of our excellent facility where we go over any and all questions you may have. An Admissions Representative will set an appointment up when you speak to them.
