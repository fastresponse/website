<h3>Customization is Critical</h3>
<p>Remember, you always want to tweak your resume when you apply for a job. No two positions are exactly alike, and each employer is going to have different standards and requirements that are very important to them. Key in on those requirements, and be sure to incorporate them into your resume. You'll know what these requirements are by reviewing the job advertisement and noting special keywords throughout; or, in most cases, the employer will state required skills or preferred qualifications. You're a perfect match when you meet all of the required and preferred qualifications.</p>

<h3>Required and Preferred Skills are Essential</h3>
<p>When reviewing the description for a job opening, be careful to note exactly what the employer lists as required and preferred. This is critical information. You want to make sure your resume communicates very clearly that you possess the required skills. This means you're capable of doing the job and performing the essential functions. Preferred qualifications are the employer's wish list of things they'd like to have in a new employee. They can live without them, but if you can prove you possess them, you just upped the ante for the other candidates being considered and are one step closer to positioning yourself as the ideal candidate.</p>

<h3>Keywords Are a MUST</h3>
<p>Many companies are using applicant-tracking software that searches through the received resumes and pulls ones that have specific keywords that the employer is looking for. When applying for positions, make sure to scan the job description for important keywords listed throughout. Chances are, any recruiter or HR person is going to use these keywords when searching job boards for your resume. Make sure these keywords are used throughout your resume, or the software won't pull your resume in the search results.</p>
