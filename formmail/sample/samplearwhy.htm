Why are we asking you to enter the text from an image?
</h2>

<p>
You're entering your email address and some details and
we're going to email back to you a confirmation with
some of those details.
</p>

<p>
We're protecting the internet from
spammers.  Therefore, we're asking you to confirm that
you're not an automated computer program used by a spammer
to send spam.
</p>

<p>
If we didn't do this, a spammer's computer program might be
able to use our form to send spam to you and other
people.
</p>

<p>
People are smarter than computers, so, we're
asking you to enter the text you see in the image
because a computer program probably can't do that.
</p>

<p>
By entering the text you see, you're helping our server
confirm that you're a real human being and not an
automated computer program.
