<h2 class="textcenter">Interview Guidelines</h2>
<h3>Before the Interview:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Be certain of the date, time, address, directions, and name of the interviewer.</li>
  <li>Give yourself plenty of time to arrive 15 - 30 minutes early for the interview. Consider public transportation delays, parking, weather and traffic. Arriving late for a first interview may be your last mistake.</li>
  <li>Prepare by learning as much as you can about the organization via their website.</li>
  <li>Practice writing and verbalizing your answers to questions related to the job opening.</li>
  <li>Prepare to answer behavioral interview questions. Give specific examples of when you demonstrated particular behaviors or skills. The STAR answer technique includes stating the: Situation or Task, Action you took, and Results you achieved.</li>
</ul>

<h3>During the Interview:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Offer to shake hands at the beginning and end of the interview.  Do not sit until the interviewer offers you a chair or seats herself or himself first.</li>
  <li>Dress professionally for the interview. Conservative clothing like dark pants, a solid colored, pressed shirt and close - toed shoes, are a good choice for the health care field. Pay careful attention to grooming details including nails and hair. Jewelry should be very minimal and small. No low-cut blouses.</li>
  <li>Pay careful attention to the interviewer's questions. If clarification is needed, state what you think the interviewer asked or ask for more information before responding.</li>
  <li>Show enthusiasm, sincerity, tact and courtesy. Address the interviewer as Mr. Smith, Ms. Lopez, or Dr. Khan, unless they tell you otherwise.</li>
  <li>Salary and benefits should be left to the interviewer to bring up. Generally, the interviewer will not want to discuss salary until she has formed a favorable impression of the interviewee. It is helpful to find out what the position pays when you are researching the organization prior to your interview.</li>
  <li>Bring a pen and pocket notebook to notate information that may be given to you and to make notes to yourself after the interview for <span style="white-space: nowrap;">self-improvement and follow-up.</span></li>
</ul>

</ul>
