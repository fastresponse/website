    <div><a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/dl/ambu_drvr_cert.htm">DMV's FAQ page</a>. <span class="textdefault">This link describes all the steps needed to obtain a California Ambulance Driver Certificate.</span></div>
    <div><a href="http://apps.dmv.ca.gov/forms/dl/dl51.pdf">Form DL-51</a>. <span class="textdefault">It can be filled out by an MD, DO, PA, NP, or DC. The examiner <strong>must be listed on the National Registry of Certified Medical Examiners</strong>.</span></div>
    <div class="textdefault">We do <strong>NOT</strong> require the DL-51 to be completed in order to schedule externships. However, we <strong>highly recommend it</strong>, especially for students who will be seeking ambulance work.</div>
    <div class="textdefault">What <strong>is</strong> required is a note from an MD, DO, PA, NP, DC, or RN stating that they have examined you and have found you physically fit for work in an emergency room in the capacity of an ED Technician, and that your vision is not seriously impaired.</div>
    <div class="textdefault">The DL-51 is acceptable for this requirement. It is also required for those seeking an ambulance driver certificate, but a handwritten or typed note from your physician is sufficient to meet our externship requirements.</div>
