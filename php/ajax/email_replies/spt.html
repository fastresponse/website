      Our SPT Course will prepare you to thrive as a competent, Sterile Processing Technician. You will have extensive hands-on skills training in our state-of-the-art lab from an instructor who has been working in the field for many years. Our SPT course is taught in an intimate environment of no more than 12 students per class. After our 10 week in class course, there is a 5 week full time extensive externship held at hospitals and surgery centers throughout the Bay Area. By graduation, all our SPT students will be knowledgeable about the details of the utensils and procedures of surgery rooms and ready for the California State Test to become a certified Sterile Processing Technician.

      Your first step towards becoming a certified SPT is to come see our campus and take a tour of our excellent facility where we go over any and all questions you may have. An Admissions Representative will set an appointment up when you speak to them.
