<p>
  Paramedics provide advanced emergency medical care above and beyond what an EMT can do. They are able to administer medications, start IVs, and provide extensive prehospital care. Paramedics typically work in ambulances, but can also be found in hospitals, fire departments, and other places where medical care may be needed.
</p>

<p>
  The Paramedic Academy at Fast Response School of Health Care Education is dedicated to training quality paramedics. Our academy focuses on critical thinking and comprehensive education to prepare you for real emergency medicine, not just for passing a test!
</p>

<p>
  Fast Response students are recognized by the Bay Area EMS community as being exceptional!
