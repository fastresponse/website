Windows does not like filenames that begin with a .

htaccess and htpasswd must be renamed on the server to:
".htaccess" and ".htpasswd" respectively.

Contents of .htpasswd is a list of username:password lines.
The password is just an MD5 hash.

The .htaccess file must have the full path to the .htpasswd file,
as it appears on the server. As of this writing the web root is:
/services/webpages/f/a/fastresponse.org/public/

This website can generate both files if needed:
http://www.tools.dynamicdrive.com/password/
