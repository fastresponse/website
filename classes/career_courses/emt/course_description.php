<h1>Accelerated EMT Program</h1>
<p>If you want to become the best EMT, come to Fast Response!</p>
<p>Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) are health care professionals who critically assess, evaluate and treat medical and trauma patients. EMTs may work on ambulances, in fire departments or hospital emergency departments, on search and rescue teams or with a ski patrol. </p>
<p>EMT is considered an entry-level medical responder. While some EMTs may choose to remain at this level of certification, we view the EMT certification as the first step into a broad array of career options. An EMT certification is required prior to obtaining a paramedic license and also may be required for certain fire service positions. EMT patient contact experience is also considered highly desirable when applying for Physician's Assistant (PA) programs. EMT certification is a fast and accessible option for individuals who are interested in medicine but not sure where to start.</p>
<p>Our extensive, five-week EMT course provides the most effective and expedient platform for our graduates to excel as compassionate, critical-thinking EMTs.</p>
<p>Our course is one of the most unique and exciting  programs in the Bay Area where students immediately put to practice their skills learned in the classroom in our simulated clinical, residential, and ambulance settings. Students will receive hands-on training with actual field medical equipment, supervised by an experienced cadre of paramedics and EMTs. Students will often have the opportunity to participate in mass casualty incident (MCI) or active shooter drills, arranged in conjunction with local EMS agencies and hospitals.</p>
<p>Students gain more experience and confidence with patient contact in the field while participating in their guaranteed 24-hour clinical and field externship in a local EMS ambulance and hospital Emergency Department.</p>
<p>Along with creating a challenging learning environment for our students, we also provide training tools to prepare them for the NREMT (National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians) examination.</p>
