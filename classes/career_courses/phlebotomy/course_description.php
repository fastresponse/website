<h2>High Quality, Hands-on Training</h2>
<p>An important member of the clinical laboratory team, the phlebotomist works directly with patients to collect and process blood specimens for laboratory testing. Topics covered in the course include anatomy and physiology, laboratory safety, infection control precautions, bloodborne pathogens, specimen collection, and proper needle disposal.</p>
<p>Our program focuses on hands-on training to prepare you for a real career. After proper instruction, students practice drawing blood first from dummy training arms, and then from each other. We impose a <strong>maximum student to instructor ratio of 8:1</strong> in the lab to ensure safety and quality learning.</p>
<p>Every student is placed on a <strong>guaranteed clinical externship</strong> in a professional medical lab environment. This real-world experience also provides opportunities to make valuable contacts in the industry.</p>
