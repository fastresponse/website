<section id="course_description">
<p>Our course of basic 3-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation starts with a review of the anatomy and electrophysiology of the heart, then moves into waveform recognition and what each waveform represents. We cover proper lead placement, troubleshooting and artifacts, and a detailed review of the ECG paper and how the paper is used to help measure waveforms, intervals and segments.</p>

<p>We then move into rhythm analysis, starting with sinus rhythms. With this basic knowledge in place, we begin an in-depth study of arrhythmias. Covered rhythms are: sinus rhythms, atrial rhythms, junctional rhythms, heart blocks, ventricular rhythms, PVCs, PACs, and PJCs.
</ul>

<p>After covering all of the rhythms, the class will use static (still) and dynamic (moving) images of ECG rhythms and apply the 5 rules of ECG interpretation to analyze each rhythm. </p>

<p>This extensive practice session is not found in many classes and helps solidify the basics of ECG interpretation, and helps the student gain an in-depth understanding of arrhythmias.</p>
