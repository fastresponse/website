      <p>The American Heart Association's BLS for Healthcare Providers Online Part 1 Course, web-based and accessible 24 hours a day, provides a flexible alternative to classroom training. Through case-based scenarios, interactive activities, and videos, this course teaches the concepts of both single-rescuer and team basic life support.</p>
      <p>Part 1 must be paired with a hands-on skills practice and testing session (Parts 2 and 3) with an AHA BLS Instructor. Students who successfully complete Part 1 receive a certificate that allows them entrance to a skills practice and testing session. An AHA BLS for Healthcare Providers course completion card will be issued upon successful completion of all three parts.</p>
