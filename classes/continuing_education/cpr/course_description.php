<h1>AHA Approved - for Healthcare Providers</h1>
<p>Our Basic Life Support classes adhere to the American Heart Association curriculum. This class is intended for current healthcare professionals and anyone entering a medical or healthcare related field. Current BLS Certification is considered a basic employment qualification for many of these professions. Certification cards are provided at the end of class and are valid for 2 years.</p>
<p>We strive to provide a fun, upbeat learning environment with enthusiastic instructors. Every class covers adult, child, and infant CPR and choking rescue, as well as usage of equipment such as AEDs (defibrilators), barrier devices, and bag-valve masks. We ensure that every student gets sufficient hands-on skills practice to be confident in using these skills in real emergency situations.</p>
