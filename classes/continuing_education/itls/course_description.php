<p>ITLS is internationally accepted as the standard training course for pre-hospital trauma care. This approach represents a global standard that can be applied to any situation and any environment.</p>
<p>ITLS courses give the student the knowledge and hands-on skills to take better care of trauma patients. ITLS stresses rapid assessment, appropriate intervention and identification of immediate life threats.</p>
<p>Our ITLS course is taught by knowledgeable and skilled ALS educators with many years of field experience. It combines classroom learning, hands-on skills stations, and assessment stations that put learning to work in simulated trauma scenarios.</p>
<p>Upon completion of this course you will be able to utilize your knowledge of traumatic mechanisms and pathologies in order to initiate critical patient interventions in a timely manner.</p>
<p>ITLS is an approved provider by the Continuing Education Coordination Board for Emergency Medical Services (CECBEMS) and all ITLS courses are CECBEMS certified.</p>
